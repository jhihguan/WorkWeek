Notes on the WorkWeek

Started a new project with liftoff in Dropbox/Xcode-Projects/
Added to github. http://github.com/regnerjr/WorkWeek

Gonna figure out how to add carthage to the project.
 - Brew install carthage
 - Created Cartfile - 
 	- added Prelude, Either, Argo, 
	- Prelude is having some issues building so, Guess I will remove it. I wanna use gordon's new Operators
	- Added Thoughtbot Runes
 - Done playing with carthage
 
 How to write an app
 	Need to figure out how to get stated
	Added TableView to hold start and end times. 
	
	Order by Start Time - Absolute GMT
	Format Cells:
		M - 8:05 - 4:02        Hours
		T - 9:03 - 5:35        Hours
		W - 8:23 - 5:05        Hours
		T - 8:15 - Now         CurrentHours

Data needed - In Time, Out Time/CurrentTime, Elapsed Time, WeeklyTime

Table DataSource: 
	Struct WorkDay { inTime: NSTimeInterval, 
			OutTime: NSTimeInterval?, 
			ElapsedTime:(calculated), 
			} 
	Store WorkWeek{ ArrayOfTimeStructs: 
			CalculatedTotalForWeek:}
			
SettingsStruct {
	UnpaidLunch:NSTimeInterval?
	HoursInWorkWeek: NSTimeInterval?
	}
	
No Data model yet. Added a tableview in a navigation Controller. Main screen is the tableview. Added 2 buttons in the nav bar, one to go to the map view, the other to load the settings screen. 

Got Storyboard Pretty well laid out. 
Now to add some logic.

Focusing on the Mapview right now. 
The mapviewcontroller is the delegate. 
Reading up on geofences. CLRegion is the Class which is used to set a geofence. 

got my geofence delegates going just, maybe just as simple as addLeaving, addComing on the model when those fire.
